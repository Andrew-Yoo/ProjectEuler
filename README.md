## About

My solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems used under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). This repository is meant for me to track my personal progress, but feel free to take a look around. I am currently learning Python, but I might try some other languages as well.

## Disclaimer

I understand that Project Euler is in opposition to the sharing of the solutions. However, while Project Euler may take issue with sharing solutions in its "about" section, Section 2(a)(1)(A)-(B) of the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 License permits the sharing and reproduction of original or modified material. This repository attempts to conforms to all requirements, including Sections 3(a) and 3(b). Section 3(a)(1)(B)-(C) compliance is handled by listing exact original material in quotations; all other work are modifications.
